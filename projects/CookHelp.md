## Project Overview:

As I began to start having to cook for myself, I found that I was starting to
generate a lot of food waste. This upset me because I was wasting resources for
no really good reason. I wanted a way to look up recipes based on the inventory
of my fridge. Not just the stuff I bought within the week, but the things that
I bought a lot time ago for one purpose, that I might use in another purpose.
Now I'm trying to build some sort of application that will allow me to query
recipes based on what I want to cook with and the inventory of my fridge. It
will hopefully minimize the amount of items I would need to buy and my overall
food waste.

Goals: My goal is to be able to build this dataset using SQL to grow my
knowledge of databases and the SQL language. I also hope to be able to directly
take recipe information from images and websites and add it into the database.
I also hope to have some sort of recommendation system, where it will rank the
recipes based on how little you'd need to buy and what your tastes are like.

Challenges: There will be many, many challenges for me on this project. I don't
have very much knowledge of building apps and databases, but hopefully this
experience will really help me grow.

Will insert code or links to code.
