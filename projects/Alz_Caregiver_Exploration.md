## Project Overview:

I thought that this project would be a good exercise in getting data from an
online source and then exploring it on my own using python and pandas. This
topic choice extends the Caregiver Collective project that we were working on
by looking at the demographics of our target audience.

Goals: My goal is to be able to understand this dataset and what information
it conveys. After this first step, I hope to be able to learn a little more
about the people that end up as caregivers.

Challenges: One of my biggest challenges with this data set was figuring about
how the data was organized. The documentation was unclear about how the numbers
were generated and gave no indication of sample sizes for the percentages.

Will insert code or links to code.
