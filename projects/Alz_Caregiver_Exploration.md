## Project Overview:

I thought that this project would be a good exercise in getting data from an
online source and then exploring it on my own using pandas. This
topic choice extends the Caregiver Collective project that we were working on
by looking deeper at the population of caregivers aged 50+.

Goals: My goal is to be able to understand the organization of this dataset and
what information it conveys. After this first step, I hope to be able to learn a
 little more about the people who are caregivers.

Challenges: One of my biggest challenges with this data set was figuring out
how the data was organized. The documentation was unclear about how the numbers
were generated and gave no indication of sample sizes for the percentages.

This is the link to the original dataset: [Original Dataset](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Healthy-Aging/Alzheimer-s-Disease-and-Healthy-Aging-Data/hfr9-rurv)

Here is one of the plots I made using matplotlib:
