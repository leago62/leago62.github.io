### Hi!

My name is Leanne and this is my portfolio.

I recently graduated from UCSD with a major in bioinformatics. I started school
as a molecular biology major, but after taking the introductory computer science
class I was hooked on trying to find problems and build solutions in the digital
 sphere. This is ultimate what brought me to data. Whether it's needfinding or
building models, I think it's amazing how much we can learn from data. I
strongly believe that ethically analyzed data can drive us towards a better
future and am motivated to find a career in this area.

Currently I am in the process of pursing data science topics with the hope of
finding a job in the data field in the near future, all the while determining if
 I should pursue a more advanced degree.

If you have any advice for me as I navigate through this field, please let me
know. I'll gladly take it!

Here's a link to my one page resume and some more information about my
background and experiences: [Resume](/about/resume)

COMING SOON: This is a little something I'm going to call my [mind map](/about/mind_map).
Basically this helps me organize the pieces of information I've found while
exploring and learning about data. It helps me keep track of resources and make
connections!

<!-- As an aside, I'm really into learning about sustainability and how to become
environmentally conscious. I've been looking into tiny houses as a means of
living economically with a smaller footprint. I also love to design house plans.
I'm definitely an amateur, but I hope to post some of my ideas here.

minima (Jekyll) to get it to its present state.
